Watchface for Watchy by SQFMI - Marvin

no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life 

there is a time adjustment routine in Watchy_Marvin.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 150 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

I know, Marvin looks a little depressed today, but remember he got this terrible pain in all the diodes down his left hand side...
